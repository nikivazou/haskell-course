The homeworks will be posted here. 
There will be three homeworks, due every two weeks and a tournament will happened at the final week. 
The homeworks will be classic comprehension programming assignments. The tournament will require you solving a two player game (like tic-tac-toe). 
We will play the game in class to determine the winner. All reasonable players (i.e., no crashing) will get equal credits.
