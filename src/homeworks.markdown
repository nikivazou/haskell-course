The homeworks will be posted here. 
There will be three homeworks and a tournament will happened at the final week. 
The homeworks will be classic comprehension programming assignments. The tournament will require you solving a two player game (like tic-tac-toe). 
We will play the game in class to determine the winner. All reasonable players (i.e., no crashing) will get equal credits.


**Late Submission Policy:**
You are highly encouraged to submit homeworks on time. 
If you submit late you will loose 1 point for each day passed after the deadline (where 1 point = 1/20 of the total homework points).
