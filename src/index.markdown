Description
-----------
This seminar presents advanced concepts of functional programming languages and verification using Haskell and Liquid Haskell as tools. The lectures will be grouped in three categories:

* Basic features of Haskell 
    - Lists, Types, and Higher Order Programming 
    - Real world development 
    - Type Classes

* Advanced Features
    - Monoids & Foldables
    - Functors & Applicatives
    - Monads

* Liquid Haskell
    - Intro to Refinement Types
    - Programs as Proofs
    - Natural Deduction

The class presents both the theory and applications of functional programming. Evaluation will be on class participation, programming assignments, and a project on the form of a tournament. The seminar follows the structure of [https://nikivazou.github.io/CMSC498V/](https://nikivazou.github.io/CMSC498V/). 



Academic Integrity
-----------
Students are not allowed to perform any of the following:

- *CHEATING:* fraud, deceit, or dishonesty in any academic course or exercise in
an attempt to gain an unfair advantage and/or intentionally using or attempting to
use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic course or
exercise.
- *FABRICATION:* intentional and unauthorized falsification or invention of any
information or citation in any academic course or exercise.
- *FACILITATING ACADEMIC DISHONESTY:* intentionally or knowingly
helping or attempting to help another to violate any provision of this Code.
- *PLAGIARISM:* intentionally or knowingly representing the words or ideas of
another as oneâ€™s own in any academic course or exercise.
