<h2 id="how-to-architect-medium-to-large-scale-haskell-applications">How to Architect Medium to Large-Scale Haskell Applications</h2>
<p>If you are writing a medium-sized Haskell for the very first time, you will typically end up with three modules: Types.hs, Utils.hs and Main.hs. While this is a very clear split, it typically doesn’t scale very well as applications become larger.</p>
<p>In this beginners talk, Jasper will share with you some practical ways to organise code in Haskell applications. Some of the questions Jasper will answer include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When is it a good idea to use something like Monad/Applicative (and when is it not)</p></li>
<li><p>When is it a good idea to invent my own typeclass (and when is it not)</p></li>
<li><p>How do I design interfaces and services like in OOP?</p></li>
</ul>
